    <h2> Elizabethan england</h2>
<p>Historians predict that during Elizabeth I reign of england it was the birth of the british empire.
During the tudor era spain and France was considered as the most powerful nations in europe because they had empires of their own.
in europe and Africa. And both the spanish and the french saw england as weak. So Elizabeth sent her own explorers across the seas to establish colonies.
One famous explorer was walter Raleigh who created a colony in England called Ronarke but had to evacuate due to disease hunger and starvation.
But established a permanently colony in Virginia named after elizabeth as she never married. and had an heir. Not only him but francis drake established a colony called new albion before the spanish could (california today)
Drake was the first sailor who circumnavigated across the world ever by doing so it gave the english opportunities to create sea trades routes to India.
by the end of Elizabeth`s reign she had 13 colonies</p>


<h2> Further expansion</h2>
<p> After Elizabeth`s death her cousin james VI of scotland became king and he was impressed with her progress to create an empire so he decided to carry on with her work.
He gave another explorer John smith to establish another colony in America which was a success Jamestown The english were successful in colonising the carribean and west indies after a puritan group called Eleutheran Adventurers colonised an island called Eleuthera</p>
<p>The success of colonization efforts in Barbados encouraged the establishment of more Caribbean colonies, and by 1660 England had established Caribbean sugar colonies in St. Kitts, Antigua, Nevis, and Montserrat and successfully invaded Jamaica in the anglo spanish war
    England captured Tortola from the Dutch in 1670, and subsequently took possession of the nearby islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda; these islands would later form the British Virgin Islands. With colonies under english authority it gave England to be involved in the sugar tobacco and cotton industry whcih meant getting slaves. England was involved in the triangular trade taking slaves to west Africa and bringing them to america  which brought wealth to England.</p>

<h2> Thirteen colonies</h2>
   <p>Following the success of the Jamestown and Plymouth Colonies, several more English groups established colonies in the region that became known as New England. In 1629, another group of Puritans led by John Winthrop established the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and by 1635 roughly ten thousand English settlers lived in the region between the Connecticut River and the Kennebec River. After defeating the Pequot in the Pequot War, Puritan settlers established the Connecticut Colony in the region the Pequots had formerly controlled. The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations was founded by Roger Williams.</p> A Puritan leader who was expelled from the Massachusetts Bay Colony after he advocated for a formal split with the Church of England. As New England was a relatively cold and infertile region, the New England Colonies relied on fishing and long-distance trade to sustain the economy</p> 
<p> the thirteen colonies expanded to the north creating a colony called rupert`s land dominating the fur trade in the region.After succeeding his brother in 1685, King James II and his lieutenant, Edmund Andros, sought to assert the crown's authority over colonial affairs. James was deposed by the new joint monarchy of William and Mary in the Glorious Revolution, but William and Mary quickly reinstated many of the James's colonial policies, including the mercantilist Navigation Acts and the Board of Trade. The Massachusetts Bay Colony, Plymouth Colony and the Province of Maine were incorporated into the Province of Massachusetts Bay, and New York and the Massachusetts Bay Colony were reorganized as royal colonies.
The church of England sent missionaries to the english colonies to spread protestantism which the spanish and french saw as a threat which caused tensions.</p>

<h2> French exclusion from America</h2>
<p>In 1754, the Ohio Company started to build a fort at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River. A larger French force initially chased the Virginians away, but was forced to retreat after the Battle of Jumonville Glen when george washington and his milita routed them . After reports of the battle reached the French and British capitals, the Seven Years' War broke out in 1756. The North American component of this war is known as the French and Indian War <p>france`s american colonies and native allies such as  New France
    New France Colony of Canada
     Wabanaki Confederacy
    Abenaki
    MiêžŒkmaq
    Algonquin (nation)
    Lenape (until 1758)
    Ojibwe
    Odawa
    Shawnee
    Mississauga
    Potawatomi
    Wyandot of Fort Detroit (French supported faction) were fighting the british in america.</p>
    <p>Great britain`s american colonies and native allies  British America
    Iroquois Confederacy
    Wyandot of Ohio Country (British supported faction)
    Catawba
    Cherokee Nation (before 1758)
    Mingo (briefly)
    Lenape (from 1758)
    Latin America:
     British West Indies
    Kingdom of Portugal Viceroyalty of Brazil
    (from 1762) were fighting the french in america</p>
    . Then the french built a line of forts in the ohio valley it threatened the thirteen colonies so General Edward braddock and two thousand men was sent to take the forts by force but the expedition was ambushed by french soldiers and their native allies and all british soldiers were killed even braddock. The french pushed the british until the royal navy took louisburg a french fortess which allowed the british to take french colonies at a time .</p> After the Duke of Newcastle returned to power as Prime Minister in 1757, he and his foreign minister, William Pitt, devoted unprecedented financial resources to the transoceanic conflict. The British won a series of victories after 1758, conquering much of New France by the end of 1760. Spain entered the war on France's side in 1762 and promptly lost several American territories to Britain. The 1763 Treaty of Paris ended the war, and France surrendered almost all of the portion of New France to the east of the Mississippi River to the British. France separately ceded its lands west of the Mississippi River to Spain, and Spain ceded Florida to Britain. With the newly acquired territories, the British created the provinces of East Florida, West Florida, and Quebec, all of which were placed under military governments. In the Caribbean, Britain retained Grenada, St. Vincent, Dominica, and Tobago, but returned control of Martinique, Havana, and other colonial possessions to France or Spain.
With the treaty of paris all french colonies in north america was under British control. Despite british victory in america they were economically weak and had to tax the american people whcih led to the American revoloution</p>

<h2> The end of British America</h2>
<p>When the british took all of the eastern seaboard and french territories and split america with the spanish they had to tax their colonies a lot of money.Which created anger among the american people in the british colonies who had no involvement in the seven years war.
A group of angry mobsters rioted in Boston calling out "no taxation without representation" the british garrison shot the rioters this incident was known as Boston massacre. Then people started to form resistance groups to resist the british one famous member of the resistance was paul revere.
The british discovered colonial militias at lexington and sent 700 regulars to put down the resistance. someone on the british or american side fired a shot and the british pushed the milita to concord but the british was then pushed back at concord to Boston.
Boston was surrounded by the colonial army which was then known as the batlle of bunker hill which was a british victory and the start of the american revolutuion.
when revoloution was declared the american parliament called the continental congress created an act called the declaration of independance and elected George washington was the commander in chief of the continental army (US army) and even though he lost a variety of battles he refused to surrender and posted his army in valley forge. News of the revolutuion reached europe and A polish cavalary commander named casimir pulanski trained the continental troops into an actual fighting force France helped the americans (only to get revenge on the british after losing their colonies)
 with the aid of the polish and french washington defeated a british army at monmouth.</p>
 The americans won a decisive victory a few years later at the battle of yorktown defeating General cornwalis with the help of the french. the revolotuin was over by the Paris peace treaty ensuring all British forces withdraw from america by New york.With this british America no longer existed. The thirteen colonies was called the united states of america as George washington the first president </p>

 <h2> British australia</h2>
 <p> Despite the british lost their colonies and territiries in america they still expanded across the world. A royal navy officer called captain james cook discovered Australia and New zealand but there were tribes in Australia called the maori so the british massacred them and established australia and new zealand as part of the empire.
Australia had a lot of riches and wealth particulary in Gold. Also the british used to deport their crinimals to Australia because it was surrounded by sea and was impossible to escape.

<h2> British India</h2>
<p>The british reached began colonising India due to a company called the east india trading company going to india as spice traders.
 The east india company then expanded in India began to build trading posts in Bengal, calacuta and bombay. They got involved in mughal empire politics which saw an increase in their profits.
The Treaty of Allahabad was signed on August 12, 1765 and it was one of the turning points of Indian history. This event marks the advent of British political presence in the Indian subcontinent.
This made the east india company the most dominant trade company in India.But the company was dissolved after the Revolt of 1857 and the British Crown took direct control of India to begin the British rule.
The british government was astonished on what their reports about India that it was full of Gold, spices, diamonds and Tea. This increased profits for great britain.
Britain was not the only country in India Portugal had a colony called Goea, the dutch had sri lanka france had yanon,pondichery and karikal.
The mughal empire was begining to collapse and the new established maratha confenderacy took control of India then the british east india company was building their own army to fight the maratha confederacy and to expand further in india.
The east india company`s army defeat the mughal empire  and the french and took most of india`s subcontinent. Then in 1850 the british and east india company was successful in defeating the maratha confederacy and reigned all of India the british was the most dominant and only nation that controlled india.</p>

<p>With a quarter of the world under britsh control and defeating all enemies and became a naval power the british empire was known as the <strong>the empire on which the sun never sets"</strong> possible due that the sun always shined in the territories and the britsh empire was considered to be an eternal immortal empire at the time<p>

 <h2>collapse of the british empire</h2> 
 <p>The british empire began to lose its territories around 1919 when the Irish began a guerilla war against the british and were successful.
Then after world war two the british were suffering huge casulties in the britsh army and colonial armies.Then the colonies in africa began demanding their independance both violenly and peacefully.
 In 1980 canada australia and new zealand then demanded their independnce from british rule. 1982 the british government under margaret thatcher negotiated with the communist chinese government about british withdrawal of Hong Kong. when Hong kong was given to the chinese it led to the end of the british empire<p>
 <p>In 1949 India gained their independance due to peaceful protest and fasting </p>
 <p> In 1960 a new paramilitary group called the Irish republican army decided to take back northern ireland violently in order to unite Ireland. (The reason the IRA may have began their war was due to the british losing their territories)
Despite the support from the Irish population from the united states and other terrorist organisations and  inflicting heavy casulties among the british military, public emergency services and even assassinated Louis mountbatton the IRA were unsuccessful in liberating northern Ireland.
Then in 1982 Argentina invaded the falklands Island (or the islas malvinas in spanish). But despite the british losing their territories the argentines underestimated the british`s resolve to defend their territiries.
The british sent a task force to take back the falklands and in under two months the british emerged victorious.</p>
